               Priyanka Srivastava is a PI of Perception and Cognition Lab. She is a senior research Scientist at Cognitive Science Lab, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India. She has received her Ph.D. in Cognitive Science from Centre of Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences, university of Allahabad. She did her post doctorate at Cognitive and Developmental Psychology Lab from Technical University of Kaiserslautern, Germany. 
                </p>
                <p>
       Her research focuses on creative thinking; spatial representation and perception; and related cognitive (such as working memory, attention, and cognitive load) and non-cognitive (such as stress and anxiety) issues.  In her research, she employs audio-visual stimuli, paper-pencil tests, virtual environment and/or virtual reality. Her research involves cross-sectional and longitudinal assessment of survey, behavioral, psychophysical and physiological responses.

        Amrendra joined the lab as a Senior research fellow. His work looks into how long term Meditation practice affects the processes and brain mechanisms involved in Attention and perception (Vision and Time) using Psychophysics and neuroimaging method (fMRI). His research interest also lies in studying the mechanisms of social perception and cognition using the methods from cognitive neuroscience and understanding how these mechanisms are affected by long term compassion training. Currently he is involved in the Enhancing Vision project: 360 degree spatial cognition.

       Ambika is pursuing MS by research in Cognitive science lab. She is involved in the Enhancing Vision project. Using a task that involves ego centric direction estimation in a virtual environment, her work aims at evaluating the efficacy and efficiency of user interface display design in construction of 360° spatial understanding. She is also interested in understanding the effect of individual differences e.g. gaming experience and gender and on spatial awareness.
